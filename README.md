==========

SIMBL plugin for use with PebMessage so your desktop Notification Center messages will go straight from your desktop to your Pebble watch.

How to use:
-----------

First, install PebMessage. Then install [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php). Then, build and install this SIMBL plugin - it should be easy enough if you follow the instructions from the SIMBL website. All apps you start after installing the plugin, if they send notifications to Notification Center, will also send the notifications to your Pebble.

Notifications from PebMessage via the REST api will work as usual.

Limitations
-----------

SIMBL doesn't work with some apps, so it isn't guaranteed that you will receive the messages for now. I use this mostly with Adium and Github, though, so surely those two work.
